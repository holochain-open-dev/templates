Notice that because you are using the zome template, this template only works with a single dna and zome, which are already scaffolded for you. It also comes with the profiles module pre-installed.

So **don't run "hc scaffold dna" or "hc scaffold zome"**.

Set up your development environment with:

  cd {{kebab_case app_name}}
  nix develop
  pnpm install

In order to be able to revert any next scaffolding steps, it is also recommended to commit the skeleton now:

  git add .
  git commit -m "module skeleton scaffolded"

To continue scaffolding your zome, add new entry types:

  hc scaffold entry-type

After that, at any point in time you can start the demo with:

  pnpm start

You can run the tests with:

  pnpm test
