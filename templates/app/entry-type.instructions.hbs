{{#each entry_type.fields}}
  {{#if (and widget (eq widget "Image"))}}
You have scaffolded an entry type with an image field. The image must be stored in the "file-storage" zome, that you can find at https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage. You must include this zome at least once in your app to enable "Image" as a field type.

If you haven't already, scaffold the file-storage zome in one of your DNAs by running these commands:

  nix run github:holochain-open-dev/file-storage/nixify#scaffold

Then, set up the `FileStorageClient` together with `<file-storage-context>` in your `ui/src/holochain-app.ts`.
