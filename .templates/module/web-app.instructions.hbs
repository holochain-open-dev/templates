Notice that because you are using the module template, this template only works with a single dna and zome, which are already scaffolded for you. It also comes with the profiles module pre-installed.

So **don't run "hc scaffold dna" or "hc scaffold zome"**.

Set up your development environment with:

  cd {{kebab_case app_name}}
  nix develop
  npm install

To continue scaffolding your module, add new entry types:

  hc scaffold entry-type

Then, at any point in time you can start the demo with:

  npm start
